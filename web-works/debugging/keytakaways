Q. what is array destructuring ? es10
ans : lets take an example

function display({ firstName, lastName, city, email }) {
console.log(`hi ${firstName} how are you in ${city}`);
}

Q: why do we use async and await keyword ?
Ans: This was the most catchy concept seen in promises.js .
when we used simple then it gave promise but we didnt get the value ie 10
to get the value we need to use these keyword since promises will either resolve or reject but to get the value of promise we have to use the keyword async and await
